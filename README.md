There are countless ways of writing good documentation. From good ol' pen and paperto sophisticated digital formats like PDF LaTeX or HTML. We're gonna use Markdown, as it is a lightweight, plaintext-oriented format which can easily be processed to suit various needs.

For presentation within fundamentals of digital fabrication this documentation's Markdown source will be converted into HTML using GNU Make, the Pandoc parser and a CSS stylesheet for typesetting.
