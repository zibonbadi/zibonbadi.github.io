<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>Alright, this is it. The final project. Countless possibilities when you can control everything from physical construction over electronics to microcontroller programming. But what do?</p>
<p>When I started this course, I did so with the intention of passing it having gained not only knowledge, but also a physical object which I could use on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>I previously mentioned being a proud Linux user, a system that to this day gained a dedicated, but niche following among desktop computer users, mainly through word of mouth. Because of this, there are many reasons someone might “get into” Linux in the first place.</p>
<p>For me this reason was preserving old technology. As me and my family never had a lot of spare cash, I’ve learned to cherish any piece of precious (expensive) technology I manage to get hold of and use it until it’s absolutely not possible anymore, then fix it, then use it again, 20 GOTO 10. However, when I first installed Manjaro on my laptop I encountered two problems which Linux wasn’t able to fix. Overheating (which can be mitigated, thanks to <code>thermald</code> and I haven’t had a thermal shutdown since ;p) and a case which was slowly falling apart.</p>
<p>Thus I decided to finally address these problems myself by building a custom case which warned me of overheating during runtime and allowed me to easily work on my laptop’s old mainboard if needed.</p>
<h2 id="design-goals-and-parts-list">Design goals and parts list</h2>
<p>The case I am trying to build will have to meet certain criteria, both for passing the course as well as for my own personal use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The case requires fitting the following components inside - Mainboard - Power button - Audio/SD I/O PCB - Activity light PCB</li>
<li>The optical drive is optional but “nice to have”</li>
<li>A custom backplate suited towards the laptop’s I/O</li>
<li>A feet-based “floating” design to increase airflow at the bottom and reduce overheating</li>
<li>Strict separation between the case’s electronics and the laptop’s components</li>
<li>An easy way to remove the laptop’s PCB and service it without taking apart the entire case</li>
<li>Ambient lighting at the bottom of the case to indicate activity in an aesthetically thought-out way.</li>
<li>A heat sensor for measuring the CPU temperature</li>
<li>A way to display the measured CPU temperature</li>
<li>A microcontroller for interfacing between the above mentioned components</li>
</ul>
<p>The final parts required to build this case ended up being the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Laptop. Duh.</li>
<li>3mm wood for the laser-cut</li>
<li>A roll of PLA for 3D-printing the stabilizing corner pieces</li>
<li>2mm screws</li>
<li>2mm-compatible feet</li>
<li>Cables and solder for connecting the electronics</li>
<li>An Arduino Uno. I used a selfbuilt clone in the final case, but tested on an official one.</li>
<li>An MLX90614ESF infrared temperature sensor</li>
<li>A WS2812B-based programmable LED strip</li>
<li>A 1602A-compatible LCD character display</li>
<li>A Potentiometer and Button for controlling the LCD display’s properties (contrast, backlight)</li>
<li>An LCD display for displaying the measured CPU temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>As almost everything electronic is gonna be driven by the Arduino Uno, here’s a table with how to wire it up. Additional wirings are written below in text form:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Arduino pin</th>
<th>Component pin</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>+5V</td>
<td>1602A VSS; 1602A A (over resistor); Potentiometer &lt;++&gt;</td>

<tr class="even">

</table>
<p>Additionally I wired the potentiometer’s output pin to the 1602A’s VO (contrast) pin.</p>
