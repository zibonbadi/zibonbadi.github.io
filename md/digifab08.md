## Introduction

As the use of various electronic components, such as sensors, displays and lights within the final projects can result in a mess of wires and cable management, it is appropriate to simplify the circuitry using a custom designed PCB. This is especially useful, as the case's components are meant to be largely independent of the motherboard and power supply used inside of it and the reduction of cable management increases servicability and airflow.
